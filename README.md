# Call-Centre-Data-Analysis (Power Bi)

## Project Summary:
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of the provided Call Centre Trends dashboard. The primary objective was to identify key performance indicators (KPIs), assess the overall health of the call centre operations, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. The analysis revealed a strong call resolution rate but highlighted critical areas for improvement, specifically a high call abandonment rate and moderate customer satisfaction.

## Call Centre Data Analysis: Project Report
### 1. Executive Summary
This report provides an analysis of the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the call centre, based on data presented in the "Call Centre Trends - Overview" dashboard. The analysis covers overall call volume, agent performance, customer satisfaction, and call handling efficiency. The insights gained from this data will inform strategic decisions to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### 2. Key Metrics Analysis
#### Overall Performance: The dashboard provides a high-level view of the call centre's performance:
1. Total Calls: The call centre handled a total of 5000 calls.
2. Total Calls Answered: Out of the total calls, 4054 were answered, resulting in a call answered rate of approximately 81.1%.
3. CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score): The average CSAT is reported at 68.1%. This indicates that there is room for improvement in customer satisfaction.
4. Calls Resolved %age: 89.9% of calls were resolved, which is a strong indicator of the team's ability to provide effective solutions on the first contact.
5. Calls Abandoned %age: The call abandonment rate is 18.9%. This is a significant area for concern, as a high abandonment rate can lead to customer frustration and lost business.
6. Avg Call Handling Time: The average call handling time is 224.9 seconds (approximately 3 minutes and 45 seconds).

### Agent Performance:
A detailed breakdown of agent performance highlights individual contributions:
1. The top-performing agents in terms of total calls handled are Joe, Martha, and Greg.
2. Calls Resolved %age: Most agents maintain a high resolution rate, with Martha, Jim, and Diane showing particularly strong performance in this area.
3. CSAT: The CSAT scores vary among agents, with Martha and Becky having the highest scores. This suggests that their call handling style is resonating well with customers.
4. Calls Abandoned %age: The abandoned call percentage also varies, with some agents experiencing a higher rate, which may warrant further investigation into their specific call types or handling methods.

### Call Volume & Satisfaction Trends:
1. Call Volume by Hour: The "Call Volume by Hour" chart shows that call volume is relatively stable throughout the day but peaks in the early morning and late afternoon. This information is crucial for optimizing agent scheduling.
2. Call Volume by Day: The "Call Volume by Day" chart indicates that call volume fluctuates significantly throughout the week. Call volumes are higher at the beginning of the week and on the weekends.
3. Satisfaction Levels: The "Satisfaction Levels" chart provides a distribution of customer satisfaction scores. The largest categories are "Good" and "Excellent," which is positive. However, a noticeable number of customers are "Not Satisfied" or "Not Served." The "Not Served" category likely corresponds to the abandoned calls.

### Findings and Recommendations:
#### Findings:
1. The call centre demonstrates a high call resolution rate.
2. Customer satisfaction, while leaning towards positive sentiment, has significant room for improvement, particularly with the "Not Satisfied" segment.
3. The high call abandonment rate is a critical issue that requires immediate attention.
4. Call volume shows clear patterns by both hour and day, which can be leveraged for better resource allocation.

### Recommendations:
#### Address Call Abandonment:
1. Resource Allocation: Adjust agent schedules to match the peak call volume periods (weekends and early morning). This could involve staggered shifts or bringing in part-time staff during these times.
2. Self-Service Options: Implement or promote more effective self-service options, such as a comprehensive FAQ section, chatbots, or automated voice systems, to handle common queries and reduce the number of incoming calls.

#### Enhance Customer Satisfaction:
1. CSAT-Focused Training: Provide targeted training for agents to improve their CSAT scores. This could include workshops on empathy, active listening, and conflict resolution.
2. Best Practices Sharing: Analyze the techniques of top-performing agents like Martha and Becky and create a best-practices guide for the entire team to follow.

#### Optimize Agent Efficiency:
1. Performance Benchmarking: Use the agent performance data to set benchmarks and goals for the team. Recognize and reward top performers to encourage a culture of excellence.
2. Call Type Analysis: Conduct a deeper analysis of the types of calls agents are receiving to identify patterns and potential areas for process improvement. For example, if a high volume of calls relates to password resets, a more streamlined automated process could be implemented.
